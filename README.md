## Features

- Simulates a card game between a player and a computer.
- Randomized deck shuffling ensures varied gameplay.
- Compares card ranks and tracks scores.
- Declares the winner at the end of the game.
- Every time the Player has to confirm something he types '*'.
## How It Works

The game alternates between the Player's and Computer's turns:

1. Both draw cards from a shuffled deck.
2. They start asking each other for a card and if the other has he gives all of the cards of that kind.
3. The first phase of the game ends when the deck is empty, and the Players have collected all of their cards so that their hands are empty.
4. The second phase starts and the Player is first asking the Computer for a collection (he can't see his own cards).
5. When the Computer asks for a collection the Player can see his own cards and if he has that collection, he has to give it to the Computer.
6. The winner is the one who collect all of the cards if the other - 13 collections of 4 cards.

## Example Gameplay
